public class OOPS {
//OOPS, is the model that organise the sofware design organise around data or object rather than functionality and logic
    //Class = Object+Methods+Variable
//class is the user defined datatype that act as a template for creating object of identical type.
//object is a real world entity which has some proprety and it will take some memory in the system.
//example fruit is a class and the object is the apple , banana etc.

//Furniture is the class as it does not exist in the real life but the chair, table exist so they are the object.


// Class defination it is a collection of the object and it does not take space in the memory
// and it is declared only once.

//Object takes memory and it is the instance of the class object can be declared and when required.

    //OOPS concept
    //Emcapsulation(Security), polymorphism(Flexibilty), inheratance(Reusablilty) and (abstraction).
    //Encapsulation helps us hiding internal implementation Or biding data or members in a class
    // Encapsulation = class(Data+Members) Or class(variable+Methods)
    //Encapsulation = Data hiding + Class

    //Inheretance = Reusability or using parent Data or methods by extending it.
    // Types of inheretance = Multiple inheratnce not allowed in java

    //Abstration - Hiding unnecessary details to the user and showing only neccessary functionality

    //Polymorphism- Means many forms it has overloading and overiding
    //Method overloading means multiple method with same name but having diff signature

    //Rules of method overloading
    //1 name of method should be same
    //2 parameter must be diiferent
    //3 return type method overloading me count nahi hota

    //overriding

    //overiding the parent method , method with same name in parent and child then override the parent method.
    // we can take refrence of the parent class and the create object of the child class
    // and it will give the reference of the object made class
    //Method resolution at compile time is called compile time polymorphism
    //Method resolution at run time is called run time polymorphism


    //keyword super and this

    //this == current class
    //super == parent class
