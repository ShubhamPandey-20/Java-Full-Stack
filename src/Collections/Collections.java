    // when we will use list when we want duplicate , order
    // when we will use set when we do not want duplicate and we do not want order
    // when we will use queque when we want first in and first out


    // List has arraylist(duplicate allower and order is preserved) and linkedlist(duplicate allowed but order is not preserer)
    // and vector vector interface has stack


    // Set no duplicate and no insertion order
    //hashset(no duplicate and no insertion order) it is a class and sortedtest( it is Interface, => implemented by navigableset(interface) => Treeset is a class.
    // if we want order in hashset then we have linked hashset


    // Queque has priority Queew blocking quewe
